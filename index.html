<h2>1.1 IT in Modern Business</h2>
<p>IT in modern business plays a crucial role in businesses this day and age the rise of the technology, means that the technology available now is fast to store data,  this data will more often than not be very sensitive so this is stored on the computer system with a backup In case any of the information goes missing. You will put a lot of the burden on your IT team to take the correct steps to ensure this doesn’t happen. Information management also plays a role in this as can play a part in productivity and to get potential new opportunities within the business, which could then lead to extra revenue to be then put into the company.

<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT </h2>
<a href="https://trello.com/b/vscwG17u/work-project">https://trello.com/b/vscwG17u/work-project</a>
<br> <br>
<p>If you are not good at planning out tasks then the project of your work may suffer as a result. To make things easier to plan out tasks you can use a planning schedule to get more organised with the tasks in hand. You can set different tasks to the rest of your team to delegate, you can then concentrate on the most important tasks in hand which you would need to do first.</p>


<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2> <br>
<p>
The risks that might impact digital projects include failure to properly plan and budget for the project so you might go over budget so its not feasible, other risks include senior bosses not supporting the project, not enough adequate training, and your team potentially lacking motivation, this is a common theme over long term running projects 6-12 months minimum. The project may also not sell in the market so may not take off so in this case the company would  have to cancel the up and coming digital project or if they have already committed to the said project they would take a massive loss of finance and this could have major completions in the long term.

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software </h2><br><br>
<p>
You would describe and select the IT systems and software based on a number of factors, you would first need to access the specifications needed for the business network, so how fast the specification of the It system is. This is a crucial aspect of having a network system as the network needs enough power in order to run on the system, others include office automation systems which is a cost cutting exercise this is especially good for the small business owner 
they wouldn’t be able to afford the top end of the system software due to the fact they would just be starting out and would need to put extra costs aside for the business first and foremost.

<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your chosen outcomes.</h2><br>

<p>Trello- this has helped me to organise my work in a suitable order which I can see easily.
Github- this has helped me to upload my website into the server is easily accessible through the internet. </p>
<br> <br>

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact on Digital Projects </h2><br>
<p>
The legal guidelines and constraints that impact on digital projects, include the main things you will need in order to create a website, these include the domain name of the website, the company address where your offices will be based from. Other things you will need to include is a company email address where customers can get in contact with you if there is a problem or just to ask a general question, and also a contact number, to make the site look professional so the consumers who are inquiring can tell everything is in place in order to proceed with business on your website. 
Data protection- many rules and regulations you have to follow in order you don’t break the data protection act, in a nutshell this is about people you can and will trust to use your data in a fair way.

<h1>Unit 1 outcome 2</h1><br>

<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code</h2><br>
<p>
I’m very happy with the website so far that I have created on visual studio code and trello, as they Was easy to setup and also very good to navigate through to the Internet I wouldn’t change anything about my website. </p><br><br>

<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code and trello.</h2><br>
<p>
I believe the tools I used to make the website are user friendly for the first time website maker like myself, I also used an apple laptop which was very good as it is very fast to load pages and is a very good piece of hardware. GitHub I can access anywhere and make my coding available, and visual code is a lot more efficient then say using word processing. </p><br><br>

<h2>2.3 access the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2><br>
<p>The strengths of my final project include me setting up the website overall I’m very happy with the final result as this was the first website I have built, I wouldn’t change anything about my website as I think it looks neat tidy and professional. </p> <br><br>

<h2>2.4 describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2><br>
<p>
The further improvement I would make to my project is that I could make the website have a dropdown menu, this would be better to navigate around the website and would make things more professional.
</p><br><br>

<p>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </p><br>
<p>
I have decided to put all of my tasks and work what I have done Into the same index, this makes it easier and more better for me doing it this way, you can scroll down and clearly see the documents on one place.
</p><br><br>
<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 3</h1><br>

<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2><br><br>
<p>
I believe I could have been more quicker and effecting with my work due to my inexperience of using an apple mac computer, seeing as I’m a devoted Windows user this was whole new world and challenge for me to overcome. And as in regarding teams we could have spilt into groups and assigned the  members of the team with the strongest skill sets to the tasks which suited them. </p><br><br>

<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2><br>
<p>
You can improve productivity and efficiency by not spending lots of time on the same task, as if you duo this you will get behind on your work and the team you would be working with on a project would suffer as a result of this, so in turn it would effect the teams performance  as well as  you’re own.</p><br><br>

 <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2> <br><br>
 <p>
Next time I create a website I think it would be easier for me to work within a group/ team to bounce off each others ideas, I think this would be the best course of action to undertake as your getting a flavour of everyones input  into your project.</p> 

<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2> <br>
<p>
I would go about testing Digital solutions by looking at the target market audience so you know which age range to target within your website, ie 18-30 you have always got to keep on top of this to encourage new customers and keep the existing ones you have happy so they are not turning elsewhere and using other peoples businesses, so then your business model would be losing out on profit you would get from the new customers and the customers you have within your client base.

</p><br><br>

<h1>Unit 2, Outcome 1 </h1><br>
<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2> <br>
<p>
My website which I have created has an index.html page I will keep all my relevant information within this page so it makes it easy to access and to look at instead of scrolling through multiple pages. I think it just makes the content of my website and layout more presentable and easier on the eye. </p><br><br>


<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2><br>
<p>
Using copyright material from a website a legal right so you would need to inform whoever is running the site for there permission otherwise you could be in a lot of trouble and face a massive fine or face a jail sentence depending in the servility of the crime that took place. Other constraints affecting websites include illegal downloads so if you are downloading something for free without the permission of the person they would then be losing a hell of a lot of money and in turn you are breaking the law so always if you are downloading something that costs money always get permission first.

<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2><br>
<p>Issues people may face when got a disability when using a website includes poor eyesight, so to overcome that the website should be able to have an increased size of text so this in turn makes it easier for the people suffering from poor eyesight, so to overcome the barrier they would face, you could use alt tags this would alert the user from a sound basically a text reader read out loud. Other barriers they could overcome is by describing your web links on the page. So the user would then have a clear understanding.

</p><br>
<br>
<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2><br>
HTML- this a computer language which beginners can learn and pickup the skills, hypertext is what you use the internet for in order to move to the next page.<br>

CSS- this creates the website so everything from the presentation to the layout is all created within this one document.

JPEG-  Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos.<a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html#jpeg">https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html#jpeg</a>
